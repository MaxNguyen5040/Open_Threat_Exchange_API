# Open_Threat_Exchange_API
A Python program to read in any number of Hash values, IP addresses, or URLs that are potentially malicious, developed with mentorship from University of Illinois at Chicago Professor Kiavish (Kia) Satvat. Calls AT&T's Open Threat Exchange API, and processes returned JSON data containing connected malware, communities, and dates. Stores data locally and in a spreadsheet file for ease of viewing. Due to the line by line nature of the program, can process an infinite amount of potentially malicious websites/files, reading, analyzing, and storing any findings in a spreadsheet.

Used to process data to suppport Professor Satvat's research in malware detection platforms/algorithms.
